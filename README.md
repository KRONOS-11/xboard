xBoard was completed for my MIT [6.UAP] project (a small scale senior project). You can view the final paper under 6.UAPFinalReport.pdf which gives much more detail and context about the project and the code. It was forked off of [this project] developed at the Aalto University School of Science and Technology.

xBoard is the only video like implementation of HTML5 canvas that I am aware of to date. You can draw on a the canvas, record it, and play it back like video. It supports saving to a database and embeds a la YouTube. It was designed with an educational context in mind, but can be applied to many different contexts.

The original intent of xBoard was to have a transcript play along with the video to account for the lack of audio. Unfortunately, due to the scope of this project, I could not implement it in time. A transcript would greatly increase xBoard's utility. Users can then have context to accompany what they are watching being drawn. Although not in the current build, the code should be extensible enough that adding transcripts should be an endeavor taking only a few days.
