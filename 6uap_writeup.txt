- forked off original project
- proper javascript object oriented design, object literal notation, proper namespacing, separation
- describe animation
    - difficulties in scrubbing because time does not hold state of board, it needs to be recreated, so jumping aaround means popping/adding drawing
    - naive implementation, going back just redraws everything up to the point you want, performance should be good enough.

- timing issues were difficult, set in timeouts. 
- storage in json


- simplest UI for adding transcript, when paused you add text. specify start/end time
- managing all events
- RECORDING -> update max time, disable slider
- PLAYBACK -> disable drawing, disable buttons, update elapsed time, transcript update
- PAUSED -> can select buttons, add transcript

clicking Add Transcript 

- limit to size of storage? param?


- separation of UI and logic components between Wb and WbUI
